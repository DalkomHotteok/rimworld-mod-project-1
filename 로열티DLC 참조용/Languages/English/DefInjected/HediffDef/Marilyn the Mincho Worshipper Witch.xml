  <Mincho_Infection.description>It is a disease that occurs when mutated mechanites is not released out of the body and is over-accumulated in the body. This over-accumulation is caused by mincho beam, mintchoco fallout, and the taking of Minchowitch' potion. This over-accumulation can only be treated through the special serum..\n\nThe creature's body that gets this disease is slowly decomposed and restructured by mutated mechanites, and some part of the body becomes mintchoco and eventually becomes Mincho..\n\nThe moment become Mincho, the equipment and belongings become mintchoco too. But colonists are aware of the disease, so this doesn't happen by throwing away what they were picking right before they become Mincho.</Mincho_Infection.description>

  <MinchoWitch_Iced_Brain.description>It's a phenomenon that occurs when the mutated mechanites temporarily stays in the brain, which absorbs the neural heat of the brain instead. In this process, it gives the consumer a strong freshness. Occurs when large amounts of mintchoco or concentrated mechanites are taken at once, such as MintchocoCake or minchowitch's potion. Because minchowitch's  brain is very sensitive to mechanites , this happens instead of ice-cream headache when eating mintchoco.</MinchoWitch_Iced_Brain.description>

  <MinchoWitch_MintchocoBiofilm.description>Wrapping the target's body in mintchoco slime to protect the target from external shocks. It's fairly heavy, which makes target slower, but doesn't interfere with the swinging the weapon. Although it doesn't have intelligence... It's been a bit of a whatchamacallit because slime is "wriggles".</MinchoWitch_MintchocoBiofilm.description>
